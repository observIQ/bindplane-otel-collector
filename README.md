## Why Bindplane Distro for OpenTelemetry Collector?

If you're managing telemetry at scale you'll run in to these problems sooner or later:

1. **Agent fatigue.** You'll manage endless proprietary agents and OpenTelemetry Collectors that collect and forward telemetry to different observability backends, leading to performance issues.
2. **Endless configuration files.** Even with GitOps practices you'll have to manage hundreds of configuration files for different sources, destinations, and processors written in either proprietary languages or YAML.
3. **High complexity.** OpenTelemetry's complexity and learning curve make it difficult to implement, manage, and re-point telemetry without a centralized management plane like Bindplane Telemetry Pipeline to standardize telemetry ingestion, processing, and shipping, with a unified, OpenTelemetry-native pipeline.

### An OpenTelemetry Collector you're used to

The BDOT Collector is Bindplane’s distribution of the upstream [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector). It’s the first distribution to implement the [Open Agent Management Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/opamp/) (OpAMP) and is designed to be fully managed with [Bindplane Telemetry Pipeline](https://bindplane.com/solutions).

### Focused on usability

Increases the accessibility of OpenTelemetry by providing simplified installation scripts, tested example configurations, and end-to-end documentation making it easy to get started.

### All the best parts of OpenTelemetry and more

Bundled with all core OpenTelemetry receivers, processors, and exporters as well as additional capabilities for monitoring complex or enterprise technologies not yet available in upstream releases

### Always production-ready and fully-supported

Tested, verified, and supported by Bindplane.

## Getting Started

Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md) guide for more detailed installation instructions, or view the list of [Supported Operating System Versions](https://bindplane.com/docs/advanced-setup/installation/install-agent).

To continue with the quick start, follow along below.

## Next Steps

### BDOT Collector default `config.yaml`

With the BDOT Collector installed, it will start collecting basic metrics about the host machine printing them to the log. To further configure your collector edit the `config.yaml` file just like you would an OpenTelemetry Collector. To find your `config.yaml` file based on your operating system, reference the table below:

| OS      | Default Location                                                |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | `/opt/observiq-otel-collector/config.yaml`                      |
| Windows | `C:\Program Files\observIQ OpenTelemetry Collector\config.yaml` |
| macOS   | `/opt/observiq-otel-collector/config.yaml`                      |

For more information on configuration see the [Configuration section](#configuration).

### Manage BDOT Collector with Bindplane Telemetry Pipeline via OpAMP

Improving developer experience with OpenTelemetry is Bindplane's primary focus. We're building Bindplane Telemetry Pipeline to help deploy and manage OpenTelemetry Collectors at scale, but retain core OpenTelemetry Standards for terminology and configuration, with the added benefit of enabling remote management with OpAMP.

The BDOT Collector can be configured as an OpenTelemetry Collector that is managed by the Bindplane Telemetry Pipeline via OpAMP. Bindplane is designed to be OpenTelemetry-first, with OpenTelemetry as its core framework. By providing a centralized management plane, it simplifies the development, implementation, management, and configuration of OpenTelemetry.

For more information on managing collectors via OpAMP see the [Connecting to Bindplane Telemetry Pipeline with OpAMP section](#connecting-to-bindplane-telemetry-pipeline-with-opamp).

## Configuration

The BDOT Collector uses OpenTelemetry Collector configuration.

For sample configs, see the [config](/config/) directory.
For general configuration help, see the [OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/).

For configuration options of a specific component, take a look at the README found in their respective module roots. For a list of currently supported components see [Included Components](#included-components).

For a list of possible command line arguments to use with the BDOT Collector, run the collector with the `--help` argument.

### Included Components

#### Receivers

For supported receivers and their documentation see [receivers](/docs/receivers.md).

#### Processors

For supported processors and their documentation see [processors](/docs/processors.md).

#### Exporters

For supported exporters and their documentation see [exporters](/docs/exporters.md).

#### Extensions

For supported extensions and their documentation see [extensions](/docs/extensions.md).

#### Connectors

For supported connectors and their documentation see [connectors](/docs/connectors.md).

### Example `config.yaml`

Here's a sample setup for `hostmetrics` on Google Cloud. To make sure your environment is set up with required prerequisites, see the [Google Cloud Exporter Prerequisites](/config/google_cloud_exporter/README.md) page. Further details for this GCP example can be found [here](/config/google_cloud_exporter/hostmetrics).

```yaml
# Receivers collect metrics from a source. The hostmetrics receiver will get
# CPU load metrics about the machine the collector is running on every minute.
receivers:
  hostmetrics:
    collection_interval: 60s
    scrapers:
      cpu:
      disk:
      load:
      filesystem:
      memory:
      network:
      paging:
      processes:

# Exporters send the data to a destination, in this case GCP.
exporters:
  googlecloud:

# Service specifies how to construct the data pipelines using the configurations above.
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      exporters: [googlecloud]
```

### Feature Gates

Starting in v1.80.2 of the BDOT collector, OpenTelemetry feature gates can be configured at run time using a program argument or environment variable. To configure via a run time argument, you can do the following:

```sh
./observiq-otel-collector --config ./path/to/config.yaml --feature-gates otel.SomeFeature,-otel.OtherFeature
```

This would enable the `otel.SomeFeature` feature gate and disable the `otel.OtherFeature` feature gate.

Use the environment variable `COLLECTOR_FEATURE_GATES` to achieve the same result. The following is an example:

```env
COLLECTOR_FEATURE_GATES=otel.SomeFeature,-otel.OtherFeature
```

By default the following feature gates are enabled in BDOT:

- filelog.allowFileDeletion
- filelog.allowHeaderMetadataParsing
- filelog.mtimeSortType
